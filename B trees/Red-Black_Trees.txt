1) It is a height balanced binary search tree similar to 2-3-4 tree.
2) Every node is either red or black.
3) Root and nulls are taken as black.
4) Number of blacks on paths from red to leaf are same.
5) No two consecutive red nodes, meaning if there is a red node then its parent and
children are black nodes.
6) New inserted node is red.
7) Height is log n<=h<=2log n.
8) If after insertng a new node A(red), the parent and uncle(sibling of parent) are 
also red then make them black and make the grandparent red and if the grandparent is the
root then make it black. This way the newly inserted node remains red. This approach is
called recolouring.
9) If after insertng a new node A(red), the parent is red and uncle(sibling of parent)
is black then perform rotation(LL and RR rotation are called zig-zig, LR and RL rotation
are called zig-zag rotation).
