1) 2-3 trees are multiway search trees with degree 3. 2-3 trees are height balanced 
search trees.
2) B-trees are balanced trees of any degree. It is a general concept. 2-3 trees are
B-trees of degree 3.
3) In a 2-3 tree all leaf nodes are at same level and every node must have 2 children.
4) Keys inside a node must be sorted K1<K2.
5) As 2-3 trees are search trees, we cannot have duplicates.
6) 2-3 trees and in general B-trees grow upwards.
7) For 2-3 tree of height h the minimum number of nodes is 2^(h+1)-1 and max number 
of nodes is (3^(h+1)-1)/(3-1) which is the formula for max nodes in a 3-ary tree.
8) Max height of a 2-3 tree of n nodes is log(base 2) (n+1) -1 and minimum height is
log(base 3) [(3-1)*n+1] -1. So height of a B tree in general is logarithmic.
9) B and B+ trees are used in DBMS softwares.
